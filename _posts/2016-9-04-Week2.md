## Past Week
This past week of school has been pretty relaxing for the most part. Classes have not really picked up, but I was assigned my first project, Collatz. I was able to setup my developer environment, mainly Docker and Travis CI, and I hope to finish the project before it's due. Class was pretty informative as Professor Downing outlined the project on Monday/Wednesday. On Friday, he covered exception handling and and explained how Asserts were not a good way to find user errors. Among the ways to handle exception were using global variables, returning a value, and passing in arguments to functions. I continue to be engaged in Professor Downings lectures and hope to learn much more later. 

## What's in my way?
Not much is in my way at the moment as I have setup my environment (I think). I still need to get a copy of the textbook and possible a new computer before the first test as my current one probably will not cut it. 

## Next Week
Next week I hope to get started on the Collatz project (If I don't start this weekend)
