## Past Week
The first week of school has been a bit hectic. From the constant catch ups to the reshuffling of my schedule, I sit here today with 20 hours of courses and more people I still need to catch up with. However, My start in CS371p (Object Oriented Programming) went more smoothly. It started with the classic "Hello, World!" example and despite its simplicity, I was able to pick up on a few differences between C++ and Java. Another thing that caught my attention was Professor Downing's method of teaching in that he "cold calls" on students. It reminded me of a teacher I had in high school who had the exact same style. At the time, I never thought much of it, but as I look back now, it seems like a great way to keep students engaged and focused. With this in mind, I'm interested in how this class will play out.

## What's in my way?
So far not much has hindered my ability to succeed. In regards to the start of the class, I still need to setup Docker and Travis CI (tools for OOP). 

## Next Week
For next week, I will probably spend more time doing the assigned readings and setting up my environment in preparation for Project 1. Learning how to use Docker and Travis CI are the 2 biggest obstacles that I'm currently concernced about. I find the idea of Docker neat in that I am able to use an already exiting image and just do my work from there. Other than catching up in my classes, it's all about readjusting to the rigors of school, managing my time, and enjoying the last 2 years of college!

## TIP OF THE WEEK
Learn how to comment your code.
This is not to say that I am actually good at commenting, rather, I believe that having good comments in your code is essential in becoming a proficient programmer. If you have ever taken a look a other people's code you soon realize that you have no idea what they have written, with this, it becomes essential to have comments that form a idea of what the person is trying to do. Although commenting seems tedious, (it is) we can think about it as a children's story; we want to lead the reader to the end in a nice, simple manner. I don't know the secrets to writing great comments, but it's a key ingredient in expressing our thoughts and ideas.
That's all for this week.
